# DDP_CourseProject_Slidigy
Slidify Presentation

Frustrations - I first tried to publish to my slidify to RPubs and after
an hour of attempts and reading help docs and blog entries I gave up and
tried to publish to my GitHub. I had numerous issues with this as well.
After attempting countless times to complete it in Rstudio via the
Publish command as outline in the course directions and numerous times
following every Suggested fix/work around I could find. I finally used
GitHub Desktop to sync my files and folders to the Rep. They do not show
in a nice slide presentation like on RPubs, but you can clearly see the
Work was done as outlined in the course instructions.
